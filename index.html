<h4>THE POWER OF DATA</h4>
<h2>Project description</h2>
<p>The network effect is a positive effect described in business that increases the value of a product or service according to the number of people using it. Facebook is the perfect example of this.</p>
<p>In 2017 it had more than 2 billion monthly active users. This project aims to explore Facebook’s features and controversies that delineated its past years. It is motivated by the fact that there are many issues with Facebook and they touch 
        all of us, in different ways. Facebook has an advertising-driven business model that has evolved in the past years without our awarness of its reality.</p>
        <p class="left"><i>“it grew and got better and now what it does is not advertising anymore. It is called behaviour modification”. - Jaron Lanier</i></p>

        <h4>ADVANCED INFORMATION DESIGN STUDIO</h4>
        <h2><b></b>Design process</h2>
        
        <p>The project was developed during 2018 at the Advanced Information Design Studio at Aalto University. The project's supervisor is Rupesh Vyas.
            The topic was chosen as one of the most relevant issues in relation to data, privacy and the challenge for lawmakers to deal with this new realities. 
            Throughout research I narrowed down this macro-topic until I identified the specific controversy of Facebook as the most exemplary of this compelx issue.</p>
